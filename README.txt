This is my attempt at a 3D engine. At this point in time, until I learn, the GUI on top will only make this engine look like an editor.

The engine can be removed from the project and modified in anyway you see fit. The GUI on top is just you can immediately see what all it can do.

The engine will be using just a list for all the objects until I, or someone joins the project, learn how to implement a scene graph. The choice, when scene graph is there, between a list of objects or scene graph will be yours.

The engine is currently using DirectX 9c with a fixed function pipeline. The engine will as well be using SlimDX which is included with the download.

The engine will have sound (object) using DirectX sound. It will be able to load .x meshes and create some objects. Terrian (object) creation. Move, rotate, scale, and color objects.
